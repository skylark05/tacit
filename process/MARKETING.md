## Story :book:

### Preamble

First off, what is a marketing story and why is it important to write out here?

People who meet and interact with Tacit will tell themselves stories about it, and they may even tell other people stories about Tacit. In the end, every decision that people make about Tacit will be guided by the stories getting told. 

All of this happens regardless of any intentional marketing, but what a marketing story _can_ do is provide an example that people can base their stories off of. This is important because it's one way to avoid letting the storytelling processes just be up to chance.

### Guidelines

An effective marketing story is one that builds off existing worldviews and fits together with other related stories. (This aligns with the theory of learning that new knowledge is built in small pieces based on existing knowledge.)

An effective marketing story also hints at miraculously fulfilling a wish.

And most importantly an effective marketing story achieves consistency through authenticity at all levels down to the core product or service being delivered.

### Origin

Tacit's story is that it was created in response to friendly programming languages sacrificing performance and performant programming languages sacrificing friendliness. The challenge that Tacit is taking on is to pursue the goals of **ergonomics**, **determinism**, and **efficiency** all _simultaneously_.

### Root

At the root is a respect for the people's time and energy and well-being. The language (and surrounding environment such as tools and community) are designed to be helpful at every step. At its very best, Tacit would help people fulfill their wishes to be healthier and more productive.

Designing this requires deep kindness and empathy, and the work is never done: by learning more, there will always be room for improvement.

### Fun

To focus on helpfulness, Tacit is friendly, playful, and inclusive, because this is the most effective way to welcome and help people. That's where the cute rabbit mascot and the vibrant pink-green-blue color scheme come from.

### Complexity

And finally, all three goals of determinism, and efficiency require leveraging state-of-the-art technical solutions. When jargon and complexity are involved, Tacit makes sure that the topics are still approachable and usable for everyone.
